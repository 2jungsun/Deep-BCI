<Correlation optimized using rotation matrix>

* Programming Language: MATLAB
* Contact: Y.K. Park (shoutme1@korea.ac.kr)
* Function: This algorithm is cognitive imagery analysis using correlation feature. We use the rotation matrix to change the correlation. Using roatation matrix, we can utilize the correlation to maximize the fisher ratio.
