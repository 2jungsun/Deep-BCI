<Frequency optimized local region CSP of EEG-based motor imagery classification>

* Programming Language: MATLAB
* Contact: Y.K. Park (shoutme1@korea.ac.kr)
* Function: This algorithm is motor imagery (MI) analysis using filter bank local region CSP. We divide the entire region to local regions and selected the discriminative local regions based on our proposed region selection algorithm.
