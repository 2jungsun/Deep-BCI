<A Motor imagery classification algorithm using cross-channel-region CSP features>

* Programming Language: MATLAB
* Contact: Y.J. Park (shoutme1@korea.ac.kr)
* Function: This algorithm is motor imagery (MI) analysis using cross region CSP. The features generated by this cross-channel-region combinations have regional information on sensor space for motor imagery and can be used to improve classification accuracy
