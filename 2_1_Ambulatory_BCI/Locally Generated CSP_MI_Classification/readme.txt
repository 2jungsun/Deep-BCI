<Locally generated CSP features and local information of motor imagery>

* Programming Language: MATLAB
* Contact: Y.J. Park (shoutme1@korea.ac.kr)
* Function: This algorithm is motor imagery (MI) analysis using locally generated CSP. By favoring the channels with the local CSP features exhibiting significant eigenvalue disparity in the classification stage, improved classification accuracy
