[DNN_Regression_Driver_Vigilance_Estimation]

* Programming Language: Python, Pytorch
* Contact: S. Hwang (sunny16@yonsei.ac.kr)
* Function: This program is Deep Neural Network based drivers vigilance estimation program. The program include a simple example on SEED-VIG dataset (23 subject). These codes are composed with model, dataset loader, and training scheme (5 fold cross validation).
