[Inter_Subject_Contrastive_Learning_for_EEG]

* Programming Language: Python
* Contact: P. Lee (lph1114@yonsei.ac.kr)
* Function: We provide a subject adaptive EEG-based visual recognition framework. This framework adopts the inter-subject contrastive learning that allows the model to learn subject-independent representation.
* Dataset: We utilize the dataset collected by the paper "Deep Learning Human Mind for Automated Visual Classification". (https://tinyurl.com/eeg-visual-classification)
