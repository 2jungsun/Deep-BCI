[Subject_Adaptive_EEG_based_Visual_Recognition]

* Programming Language: Python
* Contact: P. Lee (lph1114@yonsei.ac.kr)
* Function: We provide a subject adaptive EEG-based visual recognition framework. This framework pursues learning subject-independent representation by minimizing the feature discrepancy between different subjects.
* Dataset: We utilize the dataset collected by the paper "Deep Learning Human Mind for Automated Visual Classification". (https://tinyurl.com/eeg-visual-classification)
