[Drowsy_Driving_Classification_with_GRL]

* Programming Language: Python
* Contact: S. Hwang (sunny16@yonsei.ac.kr)
* Function: This is a subject-independent drowsy driving classification program that classifies three states (drowsy, tired, awake) of EEG features. The input EEG features are based on DE with LDS on SEED-VIG dataset. In the training phase, the model aims to correctly classify the target labels, but misclassify the subject labels.
