<EEG_ICA_Pipeline_Classifier_Comparison_Tool>

* Programming Language: Python
* Contact: T. Kang(tae1324+bci@korea.ac.kr)
* Detail: Tool for running different configurations (ICA-rejections, network architecture and settings, preprocessing pipelines, etc.) of training on the same (or even multiple) dataset.
Formats training results in collated structure to make performance comparison easy and streamlined.
The defualt networks used in the tool requires Pytorch versions 1.0 and above, as well as Braindecode (Schirrmeister et al., 2018) version 0.4.8 : newer versions are not compaitlbe due to changes to the library.
